<h2>Menu bar</h2>
<p>The menu bar has five menus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>File: file operations, loopsearch settings and exit
  <li>View: zoom options
  <li>Transport: play, stop, loop play option
  <li>Tools: various things to do with an open file
  <li>Help: help and about
</ul>
<h3>File menu</h3>
<p>The file menu contains commands for choosing working directory, opening and saving files,
adjusting loopsearch settings and exiting the program.</p>
<h4>Choose folder</h4>
<p>This item open a file chooser dialog where the current working directory is selected. When
a folder is chosen the file list will be populated with all .wav files in that directory.</p>
<h4>Open file</h4>
<p>This command opens the currently selected file in the file list. The command can also be
used to "undo" any work on the file and reload it from disk.</p>
<h4>Save</h4>
<p>The currently open file will be saved and overwrite the file on disk.</p>
<h4>Save as...</h4>
<p>This command opens a dialog that gives the user a choice to save the file with another name
and in another folder if that is desired.</p>
<h4>Save, open next</h4>
<p>Selecting this command saves the currently open file and proceeds to open next file in the
file list thus allowing swifter work when processing many files.</p>
<h4>Autoloop settings</h4>
<p>This item opens up the settings dialog where all parameters for automatic loopsearch can be
adjusted.</p>
<h4>Exit</h4>
<p>This command immediately shuts the program down without saving currently opened file or asking the user
to save.</p>
<h3>View menu</h3>
<p>The view menu has options to zoom in and out on the waveform in amplitude (not in time).</p>
<h4>Zoom in</h4>
<p>Every time this option is selected the waveform will be scaled twice as large (in height). The
maximum zoom level is 64 times the natural size scaling.</p>
<h4>Zoom out</h4>
<p>This command reduces the zoom level by half, thus making the waveform smaller. The lowest zoom
level is the natural 1:1 size.</p>
<h3>Transport menu</h3>
<p>In the transport menu the options to control playback of the selected loop or cue of an opened file
can be found.</p>
<h4>Start</h4>
<p>Selecting this item starts playback of the selected loop or cue. A loop or cue must exist and be
selected or else playback won't be possible.</p>
<h4>Stop</h4>
<p>This item stops the playback of the selected loop or cue.</p>
<h4>Loop only</h4>
<p>If this menu item is selected the playback won't start at the beginning of the file. Instead it will
start just before the end of the loop. If it's de-selected again the playback will be from the beginning
of the file.</p>
<h3>Tools menu</h3>
<p>In the tools menu most of the operations that can be done on a file can be found. Also the batch dialog
can be invoked from this menu.</p>
<h4>New loop</h4>
<p>This opens up the loop parameter dialog where the user can set the start and end of a new loop. The values
are given in samples and can be written into the value boxes or stepped up/down with the spinner arrows.</p>
<h4>Autoloop</h4>
<p>When selected this item starts an automatic search of loops in the opened file with the currently used
loopsearch settings. Depending on the settings this can take some time until completed, have patience.</p>
<h4>Batch processing</h4>
<p>This is the only tool that always is available for usage, even if no file is opened. When selected the
batch process dialog will be opened where different operations can be done on all .wav files in a folder.</p>
<h4>Pitch detection</h4>
<p>When selected this item will attempt a pitch detection on the currently opened file with three different
methods. It's also possible to manually set the pitch information in the dialog that opens.</p>
<h4>Crossfade</h4>
<p>The crossfade option affects the currently selected loop and opens up a dialog in which different methods
and lengths of the crossfade can be chosen.</p>
<h4>Cut and fade</h4>
<p>The cut and fade dialog that opens when this item is selected makes it possible to trim start and end of
a file as well as performing fades in and out. Every operation can be done independently or all at once.</p>
<h3>Help menu</h3>
<p>The help menu contans this help as well as an option to display a little information about this program.</p>
<h4>Help</h4>
<p>When selected this help will be displayed in it's own window.</p>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>This item opens the about dialog that display some brief information about this program.</p>
