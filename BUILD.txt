Build (compilation) instructions for LoopAuditioneer under Linux
------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll need standard development tools for c, c++, wxWidgets 3.0+, cmake, ALSA,
JACK and PULSEAUDIO. Also be sure to check the external libraries installation
files for more details on what might be needed. (apt-get build-dep for the
external programs can be used) There's a script in the scripts/ directory named
prepare-debian-ubuntu.sh that can install the needed tools.

The source code can be obtained (if svn is available) with:

svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/loopauditioneer/code/trunk loopauditioneer

In the dowloaded source code root folder issue the following commands:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make

If no errors occur, the binary will be created in the bin/ subfolder of build/
and can be run directly from that folder.

Optionally, the svn revision version can be specified with -DVERSION_REVISION=
to cmake and the build type can be set to Debug if that's desired.

If a TGZ package is desired, issue the following command in the build/ folder:

cpack

If it's so desired it's possible to install the program with (in build/
directory):

make install

For an AppImage target you have to have some additional tools installed, the
prepare-ubuntu-appimage.sh in scripts/ folder have the details. The main 
difference to the normal build is that you have to drop Jack support which
results in this set of commands:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DRTAUDIO_USE_JACK=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make
make install DESTDIR=AppDir
linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage --appdir AppDir -e ./bin/LoopAuditioneer -d ./share/LoopAuditioneer/applications/LoopAuditioneer.desktop -i ./share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/LoopAuditioneer.png -o appimage -p gtk


Cross compilation to windows from Linux
---------------------------------------

Basic needs are the same as above, plus you need mingw-w64 (i686-w64-mingw32)
and the source for wxWidgets. There's a script in the scripts/ directory named
prepare-ubuntu-cross.sh that can install the needed tools.

First cross compile wxWidgets. In the extracted wx source folder that you've
downloaded (https://www.wxwidgets.org/):

mkdir win-ur-static
cd win-ur-static
../configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --build=i686-linux --prefix=/PATH_TO_WX_SOURCE/win-ur-static/inst --enable-unicode --disable-shared
make
make install

Then you modify the toolchain.def file in the root directory of LoopAuditioneer
source code so that the CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH variable points to your cross
compiled wx installation.

The next steps are similar to how building is done on Linux. In the root of
LoopAuditioneer sources:

mkdir crossbuild
cd crossbuild
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain.def
make

If a ZIP package is desired, issue the following command in the crossbuild/
folder:

cpack
