<h2>Pitch detection and editing</h2>
<p>Storing the information about the pitch of the sample is a convenient way to let a sample player
like GrandOrgue know the pitch and thus be able to re-pitch it for tuning purposes and different
temperaments.</p>
<p>This pitch information is saved in the smpl chunk as dwMIDIUnityNote and dwMIDIPitchFraction
and is purely metadata that won't affect the audio data in any way when it's saved to the file.</p>
<p><img style="width: 90%; height: auto;" src="images/PitchDialog.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the auto pitch detection dialog" /></p>
<p>From the toolbar bell icon or from the menu item (or keyboard Ctrl + D) it's possible to invoke
the pitch dialog as soon as an audio file is open. The program will automatically try to detect the
pitch in the sample by FFT-based-, it's relative HPS (harmonic product spectrum) and Time domain
based algorithms. This information is also presented as dwMIDIUnityNote and dwMIDIPitchFraction
that will be saved to the file. It's also possible to instead manually edit or set the values that
describe the pitch from this dialog if the existing/manual radio button is selected.</p>
<p>Also note that already existing information in the audio file will be presented in this dialog in
the lower (initially disabled) part. The MIDI note and Pitch fraction that already exist in the file
will also show up in the file list in the main window. A file must be saved for the information to 
be updated.</p>
<p>When to use what type of detection? The time domain pitch detection is generally more accurate with
single pipe samples of lower to medium frequencies. The FFT based detection on the other hand is better
with multiple pipes (like a mixture) and higher frequencies (say around the 072-C of a 8' stop) and in
some instances the HPS method will give the best average. It all depends on the sample what method
will give the truest detection.</p>
<p>With very difficult samples I still use another analysis software (like Praat) to detect the correct
pitch peaks and set it with the manual method. As a side note I can mention that in Praat I use the
function "To Spectrum" and zoom in on the correct peak with selection until it's clearly visible. Then
I use the Ctrl + K to snap to closest peak and read the frequency value for it. After that I set it
manually in LoopAuditioneer.</p>
