<h2>Main panel - Client area</h2>
<p><img style="width: 90%; height: auto;" src="images/MainPanel.jpg" alt="An image of main panel or client area" /></p>
<p>The main panel or client area is actually divided up in three parts. The file list to the left,
the loop and cue tables to the right and below them the waveform will be displayed.</p>
<h3>File list</h3>
<p>The file list will display all the .wav files in the selected folder/directory the user has
specified with the menu item Choose folder from the File menu, the Open folder from the tool bar
or by keyboard shortcut Ctrl + O.</p>
<p>In the file list one will see the file name, the number of loops, the number of cues, the MIDI note
and the pitch fraction in cents. This makes it easy to see if a certain file needs more attention.</p>
<p>It's possible to open a file by double clicking on it in the file list as well as using the menu option,
the toolbar option or by keyboard shortcut Ctrl + F. Navigation in the file list can be done with keyboard
keys S for moving up the list and X for moving down the list.</p>
<h3>Loops and cues tables</h3>
<p>Above the loops and cues tables the currently opened files file name will be displayed. This part of the
client area can grow long and if so a scrollbar will be available to the right.</p>
<h4>Loops table</h4>
<p>In the loops table all the loops will be displayed in the order they appear. The start sample, end sample,
lenght of loop in samples and duration in seconds can all be seen. The last column holds a checkbox that
decides if a loop should be saved when the file is saved.</p>
<p>Right clicking on a row of the loop table results in a pop-up menu that gives the choices to edit the
loop in question, crossfade the loop or view the loop points overlayed in a new window.</p>
<p>If many loops are present and a loop selected it's possible to navigate and change the selection of loop
in the loop table with the keyboard keys D for up and C for down.</p>
<p>It's also possible to toggle the save option for the selected loop with keyboard key W. To toggle all
loops on/off the keyboard key E can be used, for this to work no loop needs to be selected.</p>
<h4>Cues table</h4>
<p>The cues table lists all the cues present in the file. As the cue points usually are used for specifying
where the release part of the sample starts, there should normally be only one present. However if many are
present and one is selected one can navigate the selection upwards and downwards with keyboard keys F and V
respectively.</p>
<p>Every cue present in the file will be listed in order of appearance in file with their id, position in
samples and a save checkbox that decide if the loop should be stored when the file is saved. The same keyboard
key W (as with a selected loop) can toggle the save checkbox on/off for a selected cue. The keyboard key Q
can toggle the save checkbox on/off for all cues present and no cue needs to be selected for this to work.</p>
<h3>Waveform display</h3>
<p>The waveform display shows all the channels of the file opened with a scaling to the left of an amplitude
scaled between 1 and -1 at normal (default) zoom level. Below the channels a timeline in seconds is outlined
and above the channels a playback marker shows the current playback position.</p>
<p>If loops are present in the file they will be drawn in on the waveform in red with start and end
point having flags showing the loop number after an L. Cues will be shown with a green line that has
a flag with a M and the cue order number.</p>
<p>The currently selected loop or cue will be drawn with a solid line while the other will be drawn with
dotted lines to indicate that they are not selected.</p>
<p>The current sustainsection (either auto detected or manually set) is shown on the waveform, as a rectangle
covering the channels, indicating where loops will be searched for in the audio data. This can be useful to
more accurately decide the placement of loops.</p>
<p>If the sustainsection detection is set to manual it's possible to adjust the extent of the sustainsection
directly on the waveform by clicking and dragging the end points of the sustainsection.</p>
