<h2>Crossfading loops</h2>
<p>As a last resort if no seamless loops can be found there's a possibility that a crossfade might
fix the issue and remove offending clicks in a loop.</p>
<p>To perform a crossfade a loop must be present in the file and selected in the Loop table. There
are different ways to bring up the crossfade dialog. One way is to right click on the loop in the 
loop table which brings up a pop-up menu where the option to crossfade can be found. Other ways are to
use the crossfade item in the Tools menu or the crossfade icon in the toolbar. The keyboard combination
of Ctrl + X also invokes the crossfade dialog.</p>

<p>In the crossfade dialog one can select the type of crossfade to perform. The choices are Linear,
S-curve (cos), Equal power/gain and Equal power (sin). As the loops found by LoopAuditioneer have the
loop points generally very well correlated the linear or possibly S-curve fades will give the best
results.</p>
<p>With the slider below the radio buttons the length of the crossfade can be set in milliseconds. As
all crossfades do affect the original sound it's generally wise to keep them as short as possible to 
achieve a good loop that destroys as little of the sample as possible. However, please note that this
feature always will change the audio data so use it with care, possibly saving as to not destroy the
original sample or only working on a copy to begin with.</p>
<p>If the crossfade is still not resulting in a good loop you can discard it by re-loading the sample
from file (open selected file again from menu or tool bar or with Ctrl + F). From this can be deduced
that it's wise to first save the loops in the file without any crossfades and only then experiment with
the crossfades if necessary.</p>

<p>In the image above one can see how the shapes of the different crossfades look like graphically. The
linear crossfade is dark blue, the S-shaped in violet, the equal power in orange and the equal power (sin)
in green.</p>
