<h2>Features</h2>
<p>With LoopAuditioneer you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Load .wav files and display existing cue and smpl metadata (markers and loops)
  <li>See the waveform with loops and cues drawn upon it and zoom in/out on amplitude
  <li>Play back the loops and cues for evaluation
  <li>Choose which loops/cues to keep when saved or saved as...
  <li>Enjoy bit true data handling, even if header is re-written due to changes, there will be no
            degrading of the audio data as long as audio data isn't changed (ex. loop crossfaded)
  <li>Edit/create cue (release marker) position directly on the
            waveform with automatic adjustment to find the position with lowest RMS power closest to
            where the user clicked
  <li>Edit loops by right clicking on the loop table row
  <li>Create new loops manually if one knows the right sample numbers
  <li>Autosearch for good, natural loop points with a high degree of configurational control 
            over the loopsearching process
  <li>Perform crossfades of loops when it's difficult to find natural seamless ones.
  <li>Batch process all wav files in any source folder with freely selectable target
            folder to either overwrite the existing files or create copies of them
  <li>Autodetect pitch of sample and store information in file and manually edit dwMIDIUnityNote
            and dwMIDIPitchFraction.
  <li>Perform cut and fade in/out both in single file mode and in batch mode.
  <li>Trim away unused wav data from looped samples in batch mode.
  <li>View/set some LIST INFO strings in the wave file
</ul>
