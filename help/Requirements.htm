<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>If you use the pre-compiled executables for windows then no additional
software is required, but the folder layout must be kept so that the icons can
be found.</p>
<p>On Linux, if using the smaller .tar.gz package, wxWidgets must be present as
it's dynamically linked (unicode version). The normal version available in
Ubuntu repositories will work fine (package was created under Ubuntu 22.04).
Remember that if you create a program starter the executable must be run in the
directory where it exist to find the icons.</p>
<p>On Linux it's also possible to use the AppImage version which only requires
that it's given permissions to execute.</p>
<p>If you want to compile from the source code, it's available with to clone
with git from GitHub. But then you'll need some more software installed. See
the BUILD.md file in the sources for more details.</p>
