<h2>Features</h2>
<p>With LoopAuditioneer you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Load .wav sample files and display existing cue and smpl metadata
  <li>See the waveform with loops and cues drawn upon it
  <li>Zoom in/out on amplitude of the waveform
  <li>Play back the loops and cues for aural evaluation
  <li>Choose which loops/cues to keep when saved or saved as...
  <li>Enjoy bit true data handling, even if header is re-written due to changes,
      there will be no degrading of the audio data unless actual changes are made
      to the audio data itself
  <li>Edit/create cue (release marker) position directly on the waveform with
      automatic adjustment to find the position with lowest RMS power closest to
      where the user clicked
  <li>Edit/create new loops manually
  <li>Autosearch for good, natural loop points with a high degree of
      configurational control over the loopsearching process
  <li>Perform crossfades of loops when it's difficult to find natural seamless ones
  <li>View the waveform at the looppoints in detail
  <li>Batch process all .wav files in any source directory with freely selectable
      target directory to either overwrite the existing files or create copies of
      them
  <li>Autodetect pitch of sample and store information in file
  <li>Edit dwMIDIUnityNote and dwMIDIPitchFraction.
  <li>View the FFT power spectrum and set pitch from chosen peak
  <li>Perform cut and fade in/out both in single file mode and in batch mode.
  <li>Trim away unused wav data from looped samples in batch mode
  <li>Export audio data from cue marker as separate release in batch mode
  <li>Export audio data to after last loop as separate attack in batch mode
  <li>View/set some LIST INFO strings in the wave file
</ul>
